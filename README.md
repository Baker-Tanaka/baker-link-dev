## Install

1. Short 29pin (BOOTSEL 1) and 28pin (GND) on the "Baker link. Dev" board to put the RP2040 on the debugger side into programming mode.
2. Download the *.uf2 file from the release, and then drag and drop it into the “RPI-RP2” folder (the folder used for writing to the RP2040). This will flash the firmware onto the board.
